# Capstone-Project---Car-accident-severity-
## Background
A traffic collision occurs when a vehicle collides with another vehicle, pedestrian, animal, road debris or other stationary obstacle, such as a tree, pole or building. Traffic accidents often result in injury, disability, death, and damage to property, as well as financial costs for both society and the people involved.
Injuries to road traffic cause substantial economic damages to people, their communities , and nations as a whole. These losses result from medical costs as well as from loss of productivity for those killed or affected by their injuries, and for family members who need to take time off work or school to care for the injured
### Problem Description
Residing in a metropolatin area my whole life, it hurts to see many people getting injured on a daily basis. I believe if we know the root cause of these injuries we can make solutions for the future. Hnece, the objective of the ​project was to investigate accidents, to research on what types of traffic collisions are most likely to result in injury.

## Data
We need data and lots of data to find a answer to the problems, and to develop a recommender model. Data can answer questions that human beings can not imagine and can not answer because people do not tend to examine such a huge dataset and generate analytics to find solutions.
### Data collection
The data is collected from cloud
